# Illumine Plugins

External plugins for OpenOSRS that focus on automation, this is a seperate entity, not OpenOSRS.

The purpose of this repository is primarily for my own learning but also to provide open-source examples of automation using plugins. 

My development skills are novice at best so please take all of this with a grain of salt, feel free to reach out to me on discord: illumine#0083 to provide feedback or talk OSRS automation.
